<p> USC football has been a part of my life you a long time. I have not missed a single game since I sarted going when I was 4. That is 10 years of going to football games! I would not change anything about me going to the games. My favorite memories are going up to the USC campus and walking around. I loved the energy of the place. It made each game especially amazing becuase my dad was there.

<p> Usc has had some great players. One of the most famous though is Matt Leinart. He Is probably USC's best quarter back ever! He went to usc from 2001 - 2005.
