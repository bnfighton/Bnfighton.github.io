<h2> My Review</h2>

<p> Ocean's 11 is one of my favorite movies. I loved all the actors in it, some of them are George Cloony and Matt Damon. It was a well thought out movie which made watching it over and over possible. It is weird though how when the prospective of the movie changes, you change sides. Normally you wouldn't want to root for the robbers but in this movie you do end up cheering for them. It could be just the way they made the movie or the lovable cast but I love watching this movie.
