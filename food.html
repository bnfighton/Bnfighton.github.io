<p> Steak Is probably my favorite food. I only have it like twice a month so I always am exited when I get to eat one. On very special occasions I get to have a Filet Mignon, which is, in my opinion the mother of all steaks. Amost any time I go out, if they have a steak on the menu I will try to get it. My parents wont always let me but its always worth a shot.

<p> By now you probably now that I like "healthy" foods. If we have no food in the house its an exuse to make a grillled cheese because we always have cheese and bread. Although It is really basic and simple it is still one of my all time favorites to have. its funny because now there are grilled cheese stored popping up all over and its crazy how fast its growing.

<p> I don't know really what to say. I mean, how could you not like smores pie. You have amazing choclate pudding on top of a ghram cracker crust with toasted marshmellow on top. It is the definition of heaven on a plate. There are two types that are the best and that is herheys or nestle. Both of the companies clearly know what thier doing. Dont leave me alone with this pie at all costs.
