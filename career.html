      <div class="container">
         <p> For a while It has been a dream to own my own company.  I see the hard but rewarding lives of the buisness owners and It seems like a amazing career. I like to be in control. I am not bossy but to have control over stuff makes me work best. </p>

      <h2>The Requirments</h2>
      <p> In order to own a company and be the CEO there are some requirements.
      <p>1.  You need to have money. This is kind of obvious but if you are making a company you need money to make it with.</p>
     <p>2.  You need to have good leadership skills. In order to be the boss you need to act like a boss.</p>
      <p>3.  You need to have good buisness expierience. If you are starting a company you should have some good expierence or get some help from someone who does.</p>
      <p>4.  You need to be nice. This is kind of a trait that is debated but you should be strict but nice.</p>
      <p> <p/>
      
      <h2>Plan<h2/>
      
      <p> In order for me to become a CEO I would need to go to a collage and get a degree in buisness. I would most likly also take a sales class to get the most knowledge. First I need to get a small job so I can make this company ion the first place so finding a good paying job would help a lot. Then I just need to hire great people to work for me. I would probably start out with some friends as employee's and then work from there.
