<p> USC football has been a part of my life you a long time. I have not missed a single game since I sarted going when I was 4. That is 10 years of going to football games! I would not change anything about me going to the games. My favorite memories are going up to the USC campus and walking around. I loved the energy of the place. It made each game especially amazing becuase my dad was there.
